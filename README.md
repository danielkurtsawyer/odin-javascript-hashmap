# odin-javascript-hashmap
Github repository for the HashMap project from the Odin Project's JavaScript course.

This project involved in the use of two major classes, the HashMap class and the linkedList class.
The linkedList class was from the previous project, but I refactored the attributes so that the nodes could hold
keys and values. The methods were also changed to better align with the required functionality of the HashMap. 

This was a great refresher project on implementing more complex data structures, and gave a lot of insight on how to customize 
existing implementations of data structures to fit the needs of the project.
